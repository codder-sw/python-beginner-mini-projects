✅ Concepts Used in the Water Reminder Program
1. Import Statements
import time

time is a built-in Python module.

It provides functions to work with time, delays, and scheduling.

from plyer import notification

plyer is an external Python package used to access device features.

notification module inside it allows sending desktop notifications.

Think of modules as toolkits — you bring tools only when needed.

2. Infinite Loop (while True:)
while True:

A while loop repeats code until a condition becomes false.

True is always true → loop never stops (runs forever)

Used here to repeat notifications every hour.

Like an alarm that keeps ringing after every set interval.

3. Print Function
print("Please sip a water!!")

Displays text in the console.

Good for debugging & user visibility.

4. Desktop Notification
notification.notify(title=..., message=...)

This shows system notification pop-ups.

Parameters:

title: heading of notification

message: detailed reminder message

Example:

🔔 Please drink some water  
You need to drink some water


Real-world use: Health apps, hydration reminders, alert systems.

5. Sleep / Delay Function
time.sleep(60*60)

Pauses execution for a specific time.

60 * 60 = 3600 seconds = 1 hour

So loop waits 1 hour before showing next reminder.

Like pressing “wait” button in a reminder system.

6. Multiplication Inside Sleep
60 * 60

Simple multiplication meaning 60 seconds × 60 = 1 hour

Better than writing 3600 (more readable, maintainable)

How Program Works (Flow Understanding)
Step	Action
1	Import modules
2	Start infinite loop
3	Print water reminder in terminal
4	Show notification popup
5	Wait 1 hour
6	Repeat again
✅ Why This Program Is Useful

Teaches automation

Real-life application: health & productivity reminder

Uses external libraries & infinite loops

Demonstrates system notifications

📦 Bonus: Required Package Install

To run this, install plyer first:

pip install plyer
