✅ Python Concepts Used in Calculator Program
1. Exception Handling
try: & except Exception as e:

Used to catch errors so program doesn't crash.

If user enters something wrong (like text instead of number), program handles it

Shows friendly message instead of stopping

Think of try-except like a safety helmet — if something goes wrong, you are safe.

2. Taking User Input
input("Enter the first number: ")

Takes input from user

Always returns string

Input is like asking the user a question in a form.

3. Type Conversion
int(input(...))

Converts input string to integer so math operations can be performed.

Example:

"7" → 7

4. Variables
a, b, O

a stores first number

b stores second number

O stores operation (+, -, *, /)

Variables = Boxes where data is stored.

5. Print Statements

Used to show messages to the user.

Example:
print("Press + for Addition")

6. Pattern Matching (match-case)
match O:

Modern way (Python 3.10+) similar to switch-case in other languages

Makes multiple condition checks clean and readable

case "+"

Execute this block if user types +

case _

Default case — runs when input doesn't match anything

Match-case is like menu selection in a restaurant.

7. Arithmetic Operators

+ Addition

- Subtraction

* Multiplication

/ Division

These operators perform basic math.

8. Condition Inside Division
if b == 0:

Division by zero is not allowed in math.

So we check before dividing:

if b == 0:
   print("Division by zero not allowed")


Real life — you can't divide anything by 0 pizzas 🍕

9. f-Strings
f"The result is : {a + b}"

Used to format output nicely and insert variables inside text.

Better than:

"The result is: " + str(a + b)


f-strings = fastest & cleanest way to print variables.

✅ Program Flow Explanation
Step	Action
1	Ask user for numbers
2	Convert to integer
3	Show operation options
4	User picks an operator
5	match checks which math operation to do
6	Perform calculation
7	Handle division-by-zero safely
8	Show result
9	If anything goes wrong → show error message
✅ Concept Summary Table
Concept	Meaning / Why Used
try/except	Error handling, avoid crash
input()	Take data from user
int()	Convert string input to number
Variables	Store values
print()	Display messages
match-case	Choose operation based on input
Arithmetic operators	Perform math
if condition	Protect from division by zero
f-string	Clean string formatting
