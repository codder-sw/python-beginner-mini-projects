# 🐍 Python Beginner Projects Repository

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python mini projects that I built to
**learn fundamentals, clear concepts, and build logic through practical coding.**

These small projects helped me understand:
- variables, loops, conditions
- functions & error handling
- file handling
- using libraries & APIs
- basic GUI development

I believe in **learning by building**, so instead of only theory,
I made real mini-projects to apply concepts while learning.

> 🎯 Goal: Grow step-by-step from Python beginner to
> **Data Scientist, Cloud Developer, AI/ML & Python Expert** 🚀

Currently working on advanced & larger scale projects next 💪
Stay tuned for updates!
