# Snake Water Gun Game - Concepts Explained (Beginner Friendly)

This file explains all the main concepts used in the **Snake Water Gun** game in very simple English.

---

## ✅ 1. Importing Module

```python
import random
```

**Meaning:** We are importing the `random` module so that the computer can choose snake/water/gun randomly.

**Why we need this?**
To make the game fair — computer should not take fixed choices.

**Real Life Example:**
Like rolling a dice — you don't know what number will come.

---

## ✅ 2. Game Value System

Snake, Water, Gun are given numbers:

```
Snake = 1
Water = -1
Gun = 0
```

**Why use numbers?**
Numbers make it easier to compare and apply game rules.

---

## ✅ 3. Computer's Random Choice

```python
computer = random.choice([-1, 0, 1])
```

Computer picks one value from the list **randomly**.

---

## ✅ 4. Taking User Input

```python
youstr = input("Enter your choice (s for snake, w for water, g for gun): ").lower()
```

We take input from the player and convert it to lowercase for safety.

**Example:**
User types "S" → `.lower()` converts it to "s".

---

## ✅ 5. Dictionary for Converting Letters to Numbers

```python
youDict = {"s": 1, "w": -1, "g": 0}
```

**Purpose:** If player types `s`, we change it to `1`.

dict = helps maps one thing to another.

---

## ✅ 6. Reverse Dictionary (For Display)

```python
reverseDict = {1: "Snake", -1: "Water", 0: "Gun"}
```

Used to print readable text — not numbers.

---

## ✅ 7. Validating Input

```python
if youstr in youDict:
```

This checks if user typed a correct key (s, w, g).

---

## ✅ 8. Game Logic

* If both choose same → draw
* Otherwise check all combinations to decide Win/Lose.

Example:

* Snake drinks Water → Snake wins
* Gun kills Snake → Gun wins
* Water damages Gun → Water wins

---

## ✅ 9. If Invalid Input

```python
else:
    print("Invalid input!...")
```

If user types anything other than s/w/g, show error.

## 🎯 Summary

| Concept    | Why Used                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `random`   | Computer random choice         |
| `input()`  | Take user input                |
| `.lower()` | Avoid uppercase input problems |
| `dict`     | Convert letter → number        |
| Conditions | Decide winner                  |
| `print()`  | Show output to user            |
