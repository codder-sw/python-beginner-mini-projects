✅ Python Concepts Used (Explained in Detail)

Below concepts are used in the guessing game program — read them to fully understand the logic.

1. Importing Modules
import random

Python has many built-in libraries (also called modules) that provide extra features.

random module gives functions to generate random numbers.

Think of a module like a “toolbox”.
You import it to use its tools (functions).

2. Random Number Generator
random.randint(1,100)

randint(a, b) returns a random integer between a and b (inclusive)

Here it gives a number between 1 and 100

Example:

random.randint(1,3)  # Possible output: 1,2,3


Used so the program can choose a secret number to guess.

3. Variables

Example:

n = random.randint(1,100)
a = -1
guesses = 0


Variables store values in memory

n stores secret number

a stores user's guess

guesses counts attempts

Variables are like labeled boxes storing values.

4. Assignment Operators

= assigns value

+= increases value

Example:

guesses += 1          # same as guesses = guesses + 1


Used to count how many guesses user makes.

5. While Loop
while (a != n):

Runs repeatedly until condition becomes false.

Condition: a != n means guess is not equal to secret number

Loop continues until correct guess

While loop = Keep repeating until the target is reached.

6. Taking Input
input("Guess the number: ")

Takes input from user as string

Always returns string

7. Type Conversion
int(input(...))

Because input is a string, we convert it to integer to compare numbers.

Example:

"5"  → int("5") = 5

8. Conditional Statements
if / elif / else

Used to make decisions.

if a > n:
    print("Lower number Please")
elif a < n:
    print("Higher number Please")
else:
    print("Correct guess!")


Meaning:

If guess is greater — tell user to go lower

If guess is smaller — tell user to go higher

Else — guess is correct

Conditions make the game interactive.

9. Comparison Operators

Used inside if-conditions:

Operator	Meaning
>	greater than
<	less than
==	equal
!=	not equal

Example:

if a > n:

10. Print Function

Used to show messages to user.

Example:

print("Higher number Please")

11. f-String (Formatted String)
f"You guessed in {guesses} attempts"

Allows variables inside strings easily.

Traditional way:

"You guessed in " + str(guesses) + " attempts"


F-string makes it easier:

f"You guessed in {guesses} attempts"

12. Program Flow
How the program runs step-by-step:

Random number generated

Ask user to guess

Compare numbers

Hint: higher/lower

Count attempts

Stop when correct guess

Show attempts count

✅ Summary Table
Concept	Purpose
Module Import	Bring extra functions into program
Random Number	Secret number for game
Variables	Store data values
Assignment	Update values
While Loop	Repeat until correct guess
Input	Take user guess
Type casting	Convert guess to number
If-Else	Compare guess & give hints
Comparison Ops	Check number relations
Print	Message to user
f-string	Better formatted output
